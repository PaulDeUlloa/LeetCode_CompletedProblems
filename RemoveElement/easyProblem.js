// Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

// Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

// Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
// Return k.

//! In place algorithm:

//* In Computer science an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that operates directly on the input data structure without requiring extra space proportional to the input size. Does not make a copy of the data structure.
